# Space game

The title of this game will be set later.

The point of writing this game is to learn how to create a game as a team using Github as a collaboration tool.
The game should be simple enough to be finished within a month, but complicated enough to allow learning.

## Contribution

In order to contribute, the following steps should be taken:

1. Choose an existing issue, and assign yourself to it (so others can know that you are working on it).
2. Download the latest version of the master branch and *checkout* it.
3. Create a new branch for the issue. The name of the branch should match the issue's name, but spaces replaced with dashed. For example, the issue with the name *Create HP for monster* should be *create-hp-for-monster* if possible.
4. Once you solved the issue, upload the branch and create a pull request for it.
5. Someone checks your contribution for errors, misspellings, stylistic problems, redundant codes, etc., then either merges your branch, or requests changes to it.
6. If changes were requested, you should make those changes, then notify the reviewer.

**Notes:**
A branch should be short-running, like within a day or two, it should be ready to merge.
